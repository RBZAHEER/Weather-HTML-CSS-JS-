## API

This project uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to fetch weather data. 

## Adding Your API Key

To use this project, you need to add your own OpenWeatherMap API key directly in the `app.js` file:

1. Get your API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid).
2. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` in the `app.js` file with your actual API key:

```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY";
```
